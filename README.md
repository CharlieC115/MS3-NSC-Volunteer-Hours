### Project goals

The primary goal of the NSC Volunteer Hours website is to reduce the amount of admin work needed when volunteer instructors submit their hours at Norfolk Snowsports Club, NSC. Currently instructors complete a lesson, write their hours in a daily log then this in manually input onto an access database and an excel sheet. The expenses are then caluclated, printed and sent to accounts for accounts to type the information into their excel sheets. This site will allow instructors to enter their details and their expenses will automatically be calculated saving hundreds of hours a year in admin time.

The secondary goal is to provide instructors a place where they can easily see their recent hours worked, their expenses due and their freetime accrued. Typically instructors can only see this information once every three months when their expenses statements are print but this site will allow them live view of all their record hours at any one time.

### Wireframes

I used [Balsamiq.com](https://balsamiq.com/) to create the wireframes.

### Surface

#### Colours

Main colours used in project:

* Primary colour one - HEX: #202945, RGB: R: 32 G: 41 B: 69
* Primary colour two - HEX: #ce0e2d, RGB: R: 206 G: 14 B: 45
* Secondary colour one - HEX: #fff, RGB: R: 255 G: 255 B: 255
* Secondary colour two - HEX: #cbd514, RGB: R: 203 G: 213 B: 20

#### Fonts

* Primary font - 'Work Sans' was chosen as this is part of Norfolk Snowsports Clubs brand image and this is a clear, easy to read font.
* Secondary font - 'Ubuntu' was chosen as this is part of Norfolk Snowsports Clubs brand image and tis is also a clear, easy to read font.
* Back-up font - 'sans-serif' chosen as a back-up to the primary and secondary fonts for is wide acceptability accross platforms and it's clear, easy to read properties.

The above fonts are perfect for a website aimed at staff/volunteers. The users are here to input thier lesson not see overly fancy, difficult to read font.

#### Images & logos

No images as such have been used for this website as this site is intend as a site for staff and volunteers therefore by reducing distractions this will increase efficiency.

The Norfolk Snowsports Club Logo has been used and this is linked in the header of the base.html file.
